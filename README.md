# Titanic Prediction Models App
This Streamlit app allows users to interact with various machine learning models trained on the Titanic dataset. Users can input specific passenger features (such as age, ticket class, and gender) to receive predictions, or explore association rules generated by the Apriori algorithm.

Features
Linear Regression: Predicts the fare of a passenger based on their class, age, and gender.
Logistic Regression: Predicts whether a passenger survived based on their class, age, fare, and gender.
Naive Bayes: Predicts whether a passenger survived using probabilistic classification.
Decision Tree: Classifies whether a passenger survived based on their features.
Apriori Association Rules: Generates association rules between passenger survival, ticket class, and gender.
